I am currently a first-year master student at the School of Computer Science, Shanghai Jiao Tong University [(‰∏äÊµ∑‰∫§ÈÄöÂ§ßÂ≠¶ËÆ°ÁÆóÊú∫Â≠¶Èô¢)](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn). I have been a member of [ReThinkLab](https://github.com/Thinklab-SJTU) since 2022 and supervised by [Prof. Junchi Yan (‰∏•È™èÈ©∞)](https://thinklab.sjtu.edu.cn) who leads the lab. I obtained my Bachelor of Engineering Degree from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (IEEE Honors Class) of SJTU in 2024. My recent research interests include neural combinatorial optimization, generative models, and broader fields of machine learning on graphs.

<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->

- We propose a novel paradigm Adaptive Expansion (AE) and the COExpander solver for NCO solving. It bridges the global prediction (GP) and local construction (LC) paradigms via a partial state prompted heatmap generator with adaptive step sizes for decision-making.
- We re-wrap 5 non-learning baseline solvers and re-cononicalize 29 standard datasets to provide a just and generalizable benchmark for 6 commonly studied COPs.
- Compared with previous neural SOTA, COExpander has reduced the average optimality drop on 6 COPs from 3.81% to 0.66%, with a speedup of 4.0x.

**Wenzheng Pan**\*, Hao Xiong\*, Jiale Ma, Wentao Zhao, Yang Li, Junchi Yan

- We propose the UniCO framework to unify a set of CO problems by reducing them into the general TSP form for effective and simultaneous training.
- This work focuses on the challenging TSPs that are non-metric, asymmetric or discrete distances without explicit node coordinates.
- Two neural TSP solvers are devised w/ and w/o supervision to conquer such matrix-formulated input, respectively: 1) MatPOENet, an RL-based sequential model with pseudo one-hot embedding (POE) scheme and 2) MatDIFFNet, the a Diffusion-based generative model with the mix-noised reference mapping scheme.
- Pioneering experiments have been conducted on ATSP, 2DTSP, HCP- and SAT-distributed general matrix-encoded TSPs.

- We present ML4TSPBench, which advances a unified modular streamline incorporating existing technologies in both learning and search for transparent ablation.
- We demonstrate the desirability of principles like joint probability estimation, symmetry solution representation, and online optimization for learning-based design.
- The strategic decoupling and organic recompositions yield a factory of new and stronger TSP solvers.
