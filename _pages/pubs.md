- We propose a novel paradigm Adaptive Expansion (AE) and the COExpander solver for NCO solving. It bridges the global prediction (GP) and local construction (LC) paradigms via a partial state prompted heatmap generator with adaptive step sizes for decision-making.
- We re-wrap 5 non-learning baseline solvers and re-cononicalize 29 standard datasets to provide a standard benchmark for 6 commonly studied COPs.
- Compared with previous neural SOTA, COExpander has reduced the average optimality drop on 6 COPs from 3.81% to 0.66%, with a speedup of 4.0x.

(CAAI/Tsinghua-A) [**UniCO: On Unified Combinatorial Optimization via Problem Reduction to Matrix-Encoded General TSP**](https://openreview.net/forum?id=yEwakMNIex) [[PDF](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=yEwakMNIex)] [[Code ![github-stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/Thinklab-SJTU/UniCO?style=social)](https://github.com/Thinklab-SJTU/UniCO)]

**Wenzheng Pan**\*, Hao Xiong\*, Jiale Ma, Wentao Zhao, Yang Li, Junchi Yan

- We propose the UniCO framework to unify a set of CO problems by reducing them into the general TSP form for effective and simultaneous training.
- This work focuses on the challenging TSPs that are non-metric, asymmetric or discrete distances without explicit node coordinates.
- Two neural TSP solvers are devised w/ and w/o supervision to conquer such matrix input, respectively: 1) MatPOENet, an RL-based sequential model with pseudo one-hot embedding (POE) scheme and 2) MatDIFFNet, a Diffusion-based generative model with the mix-noised reference mapping scheme.
- Pioneering experiments have been conducted on ATSP, 2DTSP, HCP- and SAT-distributed general matrix-encoded TSPs.

(CAAI/Tsinghua-A) [**Unify ML4TSP: Drawing Methodological Principles for TSP and Beyond from Streamlined Design Space of Learning and Search**](https://openreview.net/forum?id=grU1VKEOLi) [[PDF](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=grU1VKEOLi)][[Code ![github-stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/Thinklab-SJTU/ML4TSPBench?style=social)](https://github.com/Thinklab-SJTU/ML4TSPBench)]

Yang Li, Jiale Ma, **Wenzheng Pan**, Runzhong Wang, Haoyu Geng, Nianzu Yang, Junchi Yan

- ML4TSPBench advances a unified modular streamline incorporating existing technologies in both learning and search for transparent ablation.
- The desired principles are joint probability estimation, symmetry solution representation, and online optimization, for ML4TSP solver design.
- The strategic decoupling and organic recompositions yield a factory of new and stronger TSP solvers.
